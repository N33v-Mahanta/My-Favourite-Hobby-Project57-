        <p id="solvingpuzzles"> Solving Puzzles is one of my favourite things to do when I'm Bored. As a little kid I always wondered how to solve a cube with 6 different colors. I always bought a 3x3 Cube but I was unable to solve it. That was until I saw my friend do it, who was younger to me by a couple of months. So after that I watched tutorials on youtube and now i can solve the 3x3 cube under 30 seconds....... I thought to myself if i can solve this cube, than I can solve many other cubes. After that I started learning to solve a 4x4 and then a 5x5 after that a 6x6 and 7x7. I even solved shape changing cubes like the Square-1 and Mirror Cubes. I also starting solving Jigsaw Puzzles. My highest score of solving a puzzle with the most peices is 500! </p>

        <p id="coding"> Coding! I never really knew much about coding. I was exposed to the world of coding when my best friend suggested me about it. I got to know that coding was the reason why people could make wep pages. I first started of by doing block coding, and moving on I started learning about HTML which means Hyper Text Markup Language. Now I make web pages using HTML. There are 3 Main stages while doin HTML. Step1: Do the Coding for HTML; Step2: Do the Coding for CSS and last but not the least Step3: Do the Coding for JS. Now if you're wondering what CSS and JS is well they are actually parts of HTML, which stand for Cascading Style Sheets and Java Script respectively. Well that's how I started loving coding. Now even if I want, I can also create my own game. </p>
